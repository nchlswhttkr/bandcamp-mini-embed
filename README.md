TODO
 - https://botany.bandcamp.com/track/fourteen-45-tails
 - Support tracks rather than only albums
 - Handling play suspending (waiting)
 - Document that player doesn't seem to play nice with constructor API
 - Check compatability with audio/source elements, console errors
 - Fix accessibility warnings, check for guidance on range input
 - Make origin customisable
 - Error handling if no tracks are streamable
