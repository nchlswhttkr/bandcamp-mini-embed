A small Svelte client for embedding albums from Bandcamp into your site.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run build
```

<!--
TODO
 - https://botany.bandcamp.com/track/fourteen-45-tails
 - Support tracks rather than only albums
 - Handling play suspending (waiting)
 - Show currently playing track in addition to album/artist
 - Show current track's artist rather than album's artist
 - Document that player doesn't seem to play nice with constructor API
 - Check compatability with audio/source elements, console errors
 - List tracks in albums, allow streamble songs to be selected
 - Fix accessibility warnings, check for guidance
 - Make origin customisable
